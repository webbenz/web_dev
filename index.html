            <p>Web Development is the process of building websites and applications for the internet or a private network known as an intranet. Web Development is not concerned with the design of a website; rather is all about the coding and programming
                that powers the website's functionality.</p><br>
            <p>From the most simple, static web pages to social media platforms and apps, from e-commerce websites to content management systems (CMS); all the tools we used via the internet on daily basis have been built by developers.</p><br>
            <p>Web Development can be broken down into three layers; client-side coding (front-end), server-side coding (backend) and database technology.</p><br>
            <p>Let's take look at each of these layers in more detail.</p><br>

                <h3>Client-Side</h3> Client-Side scripting, or front-end Development, refers to the everything that the end users experience directly. Client-Side codes executes in a web browser and directly relates to what people see when they visit a website.
                Things like layout, fonts, colours, menus and contact forms are all driven by the front-end.</p><br>
            <p class="w3-card-2 w3-border">
                <h3>Server-Side</h3> Server-Side scripting, or back-end Development, is all about what goes on behind-the-scenes. The back-end is essentially part of the websites that the user doesn't actually see. It is responsible for storing and and organizing
                data, and ensuring that everything on the Client-Side runs smoothly. It does this by communicating with the front-end. Whenever something happens on the client-side -- say, a users fills out a form -- The browser sends a request to the
                Server-Side. The Server-Side "responds" with relevant information in the form of front-end code that the browser can then interpret and display.
            </p><br>
            <p class="w3-card-2 w3-border">
                <h3>Database Technology</h3> Websites is also rely on database technology. The database contain all the files and content that are necessary for a website to function, storing it in such a way that make it easy to retrieve, organize, edit
                and save. The Database run on a server, and most websites typically use some form of Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).</p><br>
            <p>To summarize the front-end, back-end and database technology all works together to build and run fully functional website or application, and these three layers form the foundation of Web Development.</p><br><br><br><br>

            <h3>Difference between Web Development And Web Design</h3>
            <p>You might hear the terms web development and web design used interchangeably, but these are two very different.</p><br>
            <p>Imagine a web designer and web developer working together to build a car: the developer would take care of all the functional components like engine, the wheels and the gears, while designer would be responsible for both the visual aspects
                -- how the car looks, the layout of the dashboard, the design of the seats -- and for the user experience provided by the car, so whether or not it's a smooth drive.</p><br>
            <p>Web designers design how the website looks and feels. They model the layout of the website, making sure it's logical, user-friendly and pleasant to use. They consider all the different visual elements: What colour schemes and fonts will be
                used? What buttons, drop-down menus and scrollbars should be included, and where? What interactive touch-point does the user interact with to get from point A to B? Web design also considers the information architecture of the website,
                establishing what content will be included and where it should be placed.</p><br>
            <p>Web Design is an extremely broad-field, and will often be broken down into more specific roles such as <u class="w3-text-blue">User Experience Design</u>, <u class="w3-text-blue">User interface Design</u> and <u class="w3-text-blue">Information Architecture</u>.</p><br>
            <p>It is the Web Developer's job to take this design and develop it into a live, fully functional website. A front-end developer takes the visual design as provided by the web designer and builds it using coding language such as HTML, CSS and
                Javascript. A back-end Developer builds the more advanced functionality of the site, such as checkout function on an e-commerce site.</p><br>
            <p>In short, a web designer is the architect, while the web developer is the builder or engineer.</p>

            <h3>What Does A Web Developer Do?</h3>
            <p>The role of the web Developer is to build and maintain websites. Web Developers can work in house or <u class="w3-text-blue">freelance</u>, and the specific tasks and responsibilities involved will vary depending on whether they're working
                as a front-end, back-end or fullstack developer. Fullstack Developers specialized in both the front-end and back-end; we'll go into more detail about <u class="w3-text-blue">What a fullstack developer does</u> later on.</p><br>
            <p>Web Developers are responsible for building a product that meets both the client's need and those of the customer or end user. Web developers collaborate with stakeholders, clients and designers in order to understand the vision: how should
                the final website look and function?</p><br>
            <p>A large part of web development also revolves around identifying and fixing bugs in order to constantly optimize and improve a website or system. Web developers are therefore keen problem solvers, regularly coming up with solutions and workarounds
                to keep things running smoothly.</p><br>
            <p>Of course, all web developers are proficient in certain programming languages. However, different developers will work with different languages depending on their specific job title and area of expertise. Let's take a look at the different
                layers of the web development and the associated tasks in more detail.</p><br>

            <h3>What Does The Front-End Developer Do?</h3>
            <p>It's the front-end developer's job to code the front-end of a website or application; that is, the part of the website that the user sees and interacts with. They take the back-end data and turn it into something that is easily comprehensible,
                visually pleasing and fully functional for the everyday user. They will work from designs provided by the web designer and bring them to life using HTML, CSS and Javascript (more on those later!).</p><br>
            <p>The front-end developer implements the website's layout. interactive and navigational elements such as buttons and scrollbars, images and content and internal links (links that navigate from one page to another within the sme website). Front-end
                developers are also responsible for ensuring optimal display across different browsers and devices. They will code the website in such a way that makes it responsive or adaptive to various screen sizes, so that user gets the same experience
                whether they're visiting the website on mobile, desktop or tablet.</p><br>
            <p>Front-end Developer will also carry out usability tests and fix any bugs that arise. At the same time, they will consider SEO best practices, maintain software workflow management, nd develop tools that enhance how the user interacts with
                a website in any browser.</p><br>

                and a database.</p><br>
            <p>The code that back-end developers create ensures that everything the front-end developer build is fully functional, and it is the back-end developer's job to make sure that the server, application and database all communicate with each other.
                So how do they do this? First, they use server-side languages such as PHP, Ruby, Python and Java to build the application. Then they use tools like MySQL, Oracle and SQL server to find, save or edit data and deliver it back to the user
                in front-end code.</p><br>
            <p>Just like front-end developers, back-end developers will liaise with the client or business owner in order to understand their needs and requirements. They will then deliver these in a number of ways depending on the specifics of the project.
                Typical back-end development tasks include creating, integrating and managing the database, building server-side software using back-end frameworks, developing and deploying content management systems (for a blog, for example), as well
                as working with web server technologies, API integration and operating systems. </p><br>

            <h3>Programming Languages, Libraries and Frameworks</h3>
            <p>In order to build websites and apps, web developers work with languages, libraries and frameworks. Let's take a look at each of these in detail, as well as some other tools that web developers use in their day-to-day work.</p><br>

            <h4><b>What Are Languages?</b></h4><br>
            <p>In the world of web development, languages are the building blocks that programmers use to create websites, apps and software. There are all different types of languages, including programming languages, mark-up languages, stylesheet languages
                and database languages.</p><br>

            <h5><b>Programming Languages</b></h5><br>
            <p>A programming language is essentially a set of instructions and commands which tell the computer to produce a certain output. Programmers use so called "high-level" programming languages to write source code. High Level languages use logical
                words and symbols making executes code. Interpreted languages are generally used for running scripts, such as those used to generate content for dynamic websites.</p><br>
            <p>Low-level languages are those that can be directly recognized by and executed on the computer hardware; they don't need to be interpreted or translated. Machine Language and assembly language are some common examples of low-level languages.</p><br>
            <p>Some of the most popular languages of 2018 include Java, C, C++, Python, C#, Javascript, PHP, Ruby and Perl.</p><br>

            <h5><b>Mark-up Languages</b></h5><br>
            <p>Mark-up languages are used to specify the formatting of a text file. In other words, a mark-up language tells the software that display the text how the text should be formatted. Mark-up languages are completely legible to the human eye --
                they contain standard words -- but the mark-up tags are not visible in the final output.</p><br>
            <p>The two most popular Mark-up languages are HTML and XML. <b class="w3-text-blue">HTML</b> stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used for the creation of websites. When added to plain text document, HTML tags describe how this document
                should be displayed by a web browser. <b class="w3-text-blue">XML</b> stands for eXtensible Mark-up Language. It is a mark-up language very similar to HTML; However, while HTML was designed to display data with a focus on how it looks,
                XML was designed purely to store and transport data. Unlike HTML, XML tags are not predefined; rather, they are created by the author of the document. The point of XML is to simplify data sharing and transport, platform changes and data
                availability, as it provides a software and hardware independent means storing, transporting and sharing data.</p><br>

            <h5><b>StyleSheet Languages</b></h5><br>
            <p>A stylesheet is basically a set of stylistic rules. Style Sheet Languages are used, quite literally, to style documents that are written in mark-up languages. </p><br>
            <p>Consider a document written in HTML and styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), a style sheet language. The HTML is responsible for the content and structure of the web page, while
                <b class="w3-text-blue">CSS determines how this content should be presented visually.</b> Can be used to add colours, change fonts, insert backgrounds and borders, as well s to style forms. CSS is also used to optimize web pages for responsive
                design, ensuring they adapt their layout to whatever device the user is on.</p><br>

            <h5><b>Database Language</b></h5><br>
            <p>Languages re not only used for building websites, software and apps; they are also used to create and manage databases.</p><br>
            <p>Databases are used to store huge volumes of data. The <b class="w3-text-blue">Spotify</b> music app, for example, uses databases store music files, as well as data about the user's listening preferences. Likewise, social media apps like Instagram
                uses databases to store user profile information; every time a user updates their profile in some way, the app's database will also update.</p><br>
            <p>Databases are not designed to understand the same languages that apps are programmed in, So, it's essential to have a language that they do understand -- like SQL, the standard language for accessing and manipulating relational databases.
                SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It has its own markup, and basically enables programmers to work with the data held in a database system. </p><br>

            <h4><b>What are Libraries and Frameworks?</b></h4><br>
            <p>Web developers also work with libraries and frameworks. Despite much confusion, they are not the same thing -- although they are both there to make the developer's job easier.</p><br>
            <p>Libraries and Frameworks are essentially sets of pre-written code, but libraries are smaller and tend to be used for more specific use-cases. A <b class="w3-text-blue">Library</b> contains a collection of useful code, grouped together to be
                reused later. The purposed of a library is to enable developers to reach the same end goal while writing less code to get there.</p><br>
            <p>Let's take the example of Javascript, the language, and jQuery, a Javascript Library. Rather than writing, say,ten lines of code in Javascript, the developer can take the condensed, pre-written version from the jQuery Library -- saving time
                and effort.</p><br>
            <p>A <b class="w3-text-blue">Frameworks</b> contains ready-made components and tools that enable the developer to <b class="w3-text-blue">write code</b> faster, and many frameworks also contain libraries. It gives developer structure to work
                from, and the framework you choose to work with will largely dictate the way you build your website or app, so choosing a framework is a big decision. Some popular Frameworks include <b class="w3-text-blue">Bootstrap</b>, Rails and Angular.</p><br>
            <p>The easiest way to understand libraries and Frameworks is to imagine you are building a house. The Frameworks provides the foundation and the structure, as well as instructions or guidelines for completing certain tasks. Say you want to install
                an oven in your new home: you could buy a separate components and build the oven from scratch, or you would pick a ready-made oven from the store. Just like building a website, you can write the code from scratch or you can take pre-written
                code from a library and simple insert it.</p>

            <h3>Other Web Development Tools</h3><br>
            <p>Web Developers will also use a text editor, such as <b class="w3-text-blue">Atom</b>, <b class="w3-text-blue">Sublime</b> or <b class="w3-text-blue">Visual Studio Code</b>, to write their code; a web browser, such as <b class="w3-text-blue">Chrome</b>                or
                <b class="w3-text-blue">Firefox</b> and an extremely crucial tool: Git!.</p><br>
            <p>Git is a <b class="w3-text-blue">version control</b> system where developers cn store and manage their code. As a web developer, it's inevitable that you'll make constant changes to your code, so a tool like Git that enables you to track these
                changes and reverse them if necessary is extremely valuable. Git also makes it easier to work with other teams and to manage multiple projects at once. Git has become such a staple in the world of web development that it's now considered
                really bad practice not to use it.</p><br>
            <p>Another extremely popular tool is GitHub, a cloud interface for Git. GitHub offers all the version control functionality of Git, but also comes with its own features such as bug tracking, task management and project wikis. GitHub not only
                hosts repositories; it also provides developers with a comprehensive tool-set, making it easier to follow best practices for coding. It is considered the place to be for open-source projects, and also provides a platform for web developers
                to showcase their skills.</p>
